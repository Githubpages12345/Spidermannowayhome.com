<h1>Spiderman no way home</h1>
<p>It’s well-known to Spider-Man fans that Sony had plans for a Sinister Six movie. After the less-than-enthusiastic reception of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the project was canceled. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has used the concept in a different way. The recent release Spider-Man: No Way Home brings Spider-Man's most notorious villains together for a team-up that's practically torn out of the Sinister Six storylines..
    Mysterio Is Technically Present Through Archived Footage
    While not among the Multiverse villains, Mysterio still deserves to be mentioned, if only because he is the primary reason for the unfolding chaos. In Spider-Man: Far From Home, Quentin Beck manages to fool Peter Parker into giving him Tony Stark’s AI, EDITH. He is eventually defeated and dies because of the gunfire of his own drones.

    But in the aftermath, footage filmed before his death is released by the Daily Bugle, revealing Spider-Man’s true identity as Peter Parker and framing him as the culprit behind the elemental attacks and Mysterio’s brutal murder. In No Way Home, Mysterio only appears through archived footage, but he remains one of the cruelest and least likable opponents Peter has ever had to face.
    When it comes to Spider-Man’s villains, Electro has never been the most powerful or the biggest threat. That changes when he gets his hands on one of Tony Stark’s arc reactors. Powered by Tony’s tech, he is probably among the strongest characters in No Way Home.
    He originally agrees with Peter’s idea of finding a cure, but his hunger for power and attention makes him vulnerable to Green Goblin’s manipulations. Prior to his transformation, he appears to have had a gentle demeanor, but his arrogance as Electro is unlikable. He deems himself pathetic without his powers, which is a shame, because he may have been more interesting without them.
    Even a giant man-like lizard can be uninteresting if he doesn’t have a big enough role. The main villain in The Amazing Spider-Man, Doctor Curt Connors is nicknamed ‘the dinosaur’ by Ned Leeds due to his unusual look. Ned is shocked that the Lizard can even speak, but that’s not just because of his appearance.

In No Way Home, the Lizard has a small role. He is skeptical of Peter’s plan, proving that he is more rational than he looks, but in the end, he doesn’t provide a big contribution beyond the occasional rampage.
Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy has brought Marvel fans some of the most memorable villains in superhero movie history, and the Green Goblin is certainly included. Willem Dafoe returns for a masterful performance. His depiction of Norman Osborn is emotional as No Way Home focuses on his mental health issues. Upon realizing he is no longer in his own world, Norman abandons the Goblin suit and seeks help, his original demeanor being a key factor in Peter’s decision to cure the Multiverse villains.
Unfortunately, Norman ultimately loses the battle with the Green Goblin. A fight erupts between him and Spider-Man, and Peter’s Aunt May is killed. Peter is so grief-stricken he comes close to killing him, and fans can empathize. The Green Goblin won’t be winning any popularity contests anytime soon.
Unlike many of Spider-Man’s villains, Flint Marko isn’t all that bright. But what he lacks in intelligence, he compensates in brawn. An experiment gone wrong gives him the ability to turn his body into sand, and he proves to be adept in both evading Spidey’s attacks and crushing the wall-crawling superhero through overwhelming waves of sand.

Ironically, Flint is one of the more likable Multiverse villains. During his first meeting with Peter, he even protects him from Electro’s attack. Sandman does eventually turn against Peter, but that appears to be out of the desperation to go back to his daughter’s side, rather than the desire to destroy or a hunger for power.
Venom: Let There Be Carnage shocked audiences when its post-credit scene displayed Eddie and the symbiote in a reality that included Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. No Way Home includes a cameo of Venom during the mid-credits scene. Eddie is drinking cocktails and discussing the events of the MCU, while the symbiote provides occasionally angry commentary. It’s not a long scene, but it doesn’t have to be.

The Tom Hardy Venom movies may not always be original in terms of plot, but Venom and Eddie have always been a likable duo, and their dynamic is a joy to watch. Their departure from the MCU leaves behind a part of the symbiote, which promises the addition of 
With Aaron Taylor-Johnson recently cast as Kraven The Hunter, it’s a simple assumption that we’ll see him face off against Spider-Man somewhere down the line. Some speculated that we could have seen him in the upcoming third installment of the Homecoming series, adapting parts of the popular comic, Kraven’s Last Hunt. The comic saw Kraven hunting down Spider-Man, which people speculated could be used in the new film due to Peter Parker’s identity becoming public and him likely becoming a popular fugitive.

Past rumors also indicated that Kraven The Hunter was a part of early drafts of the third film, likely before Marvel decided to go ahead with a multiverse story. It’s highly likely Kraven The Hunter isn’t far behind with Aaron Taylor-Johnson cast and other Spidey villains, like Venom, seemingly teleported into the MCU after Peter interrupted Dr. Strange’s spell in Spider-Man: No Way Home.

<h1>characters in no way home </h1>
<p>After being tracked by Peter, Electro appears deep in the forests around a collection of massive power lines. At first, he has no idea where he could be, but Electro's body forms from the ambient energy of the powerlines, and he's quickly sent to his cell in Doctor Strange's dungeon. However, unlike the other villains, Electro is only interested in obtaining power. This leads him to find one of Tony Stark's arc reactors, which he uses to grow his strength. Now, rather than go back to his world, he instead prefers to stay and obtain even more power here, with the ultimate goal of being the strongest being alive..</p>

<h1>Tobey maguire's spiderman</h1>
<p>The oldest and most iconic Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire's version, appears at the same time the villains do, but this one exists long after the conclusion of Spider-Man 3 as someone trying to be a better person. When he's called through a portal by Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), he explains that he saw what happened to this version's Peter and feels that he's needed. He still acts like the cool and collected Peter from the past films, but his experience shines when he puts on the suit. Unlike Garfield's Peter, Maguire acts more like a mentor and helps Peter at a crucial moment in his life, saving him from going down a dark path..</p>

<h1>Andrew garfield Spiderman </h1>
<p>Similar to Maguire, Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man arrives at the same time as the villains but isn't formally introduced until Ned opens a portal calling him forth. Like Maguire's Peter, this version is also older than the villains Holland is facing and has his own experiences. He agrees to help the other Peters rehabilitate the villains and send everyone home, but it's clear he hasn't fully healed after Gwen's death. This is later explained by how he began to get careless fighting crime, pulling his punches less out of anger. Because of his guilt, this Peter's arc is about finding his inner-hero and proving to himself he deserves to keep fighting.h.</p>

<h1>Amazing spiderman's Lizard </h1>
<p>Unlike the other villains, the Lizard's (Rhys Ifans) appearance in the MCU isn't shown. However, he seems even more vicious than ever before, even injuring Doctor Strange during his capture. Like in The Amazing Spider-Man, The Lizard only wishes to "cure" weakness by turning everyone into lizards, but unlike the previous version, this one seems more focused on his goal, acting more like a wild scientist mixed with a dangerous animal. Also, compared to the other villains, his place among them feels more circumstantial, as he doesn't offer to help the other villains stay in the MCU and only wishes to stop Spider-Man and return to his plans..

<h1>Spiderman's green goblin</h1>
<p>Just as deadly as he was when he first appeared, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) appears moments after Peter defeats Doc Ock (Alfred Molina). He then reappears as an ally to Peter, offering to help him cure himself and the other villains. However, it's revealed that what he wants more than anything is to make Spider-Man suffer. Following a betrayal that leads to Aunt May's (Marisa Tomei) death, it becomes clear that curing himself was never in the cards. Instead, this version of the Goblin is still just as deadly as the one that came before and has no issues staying in the MCU to torment Peter..</p>

<h1>Spiderman 3 Sandman</h1>
<p>In Spider-Man 3, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman wants nothing more than to get money to help his sick daughter, but in doing so, he becomes a being made entirely of sand who steals to get the funds he needs. He appears in the MCU protecting Holland's Peter from an attack by Electro (Jamie Foxx). He seems like an ally at first, but after seeing Peter send Electro to his cell, he stops trusting the other Spider-Man and decides to do anything he can to return home, even if it means killing Peter and his allies. This leads to him going on the offensive and nearly killing Maguire's Peter in the Statue of Liberty..</p>

<h1>Doc ock</h1>
<p>Doc Ock first appears on a bridge, attacking Peter, who is trying to convince a head member of MIT to let his friends into their college. Doc Ock believes that this Peter is the one he knows and confronts him for taking him away from his fusion reactor. Peter eventually outsmarts him thanks to his nanotech pairing with Ock's tentacles. However, Otto is still obsessed with completing his experiment and will stop at nothing to get back to his world. However, Peter decides to find a way to give Otto control over his tentacles again, curing the scientist and making him an invaluable addition to the final battle..

<h1>Venom</h1>
<p>Venom's introduction to the MCU is first shown in a post-credits scene for Venom: Let There Be Carnage. After that, however, he isn't seen again until the after credits of No Way Home, where he tries to make sense of the universe he's trapped in. His main goal is to get answers to his current predicament, but before he can, he's sent back to his homeworld. However, Venom leaves behind a part of himself in the transition, likely to find its way to someone in the future. While he doesn't play an active role in the film, the implications for what's left behind is massive..</p>
